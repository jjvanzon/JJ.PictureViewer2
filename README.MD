JJ.PictureViewer2
=======================

*Jan-Joost van Zon, 2010-10*

This is a Visual Studio 2010 C# project.

A simple picture viewer program.
You can browse folders and files with it,
view pictures using arrow keys up and down,
rate them with keyboard keys, such as 'G' - Good, 'N' - Not Great,
which automatically moves the file to a sub folder with a name the same as the rating name.
Pictures are zoomed to fit the window.
You can also view full screen.
